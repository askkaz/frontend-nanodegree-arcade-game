===============================
This is a clone of the frogger arcade game.  The goal is to get your hero to the water without being hit by one of the bugs.

The game is played by opening the file "index.html" in a web browser.  Your hero's motion around the screen is controlled with the arrow keys (left, up, right, and down).  Upon reaching the water, the level advances and the hero is reset to the starting point.  Each level brings more bugs and faster bugs.  Game over happens when the hero is run over by a bug.

Enjoy.
